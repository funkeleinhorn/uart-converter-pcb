# My first PCB (an UART Converter)

This is the first PCB I have designed to learn [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).
It is an USB-C to UART Converter supporting 3.3V using an [FT230X](https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DS_FT230X.pdf).
Thanks a lot to [@Cutie-PHY](https://fosstodon.org/@sad_electronics) for teaching me KiCad and helping me to get this PCB designed and manufactured.
